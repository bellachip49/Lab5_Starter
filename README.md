## Explore - Check Your Understanding (Responses):
1. Unit testing is important for features like sending a message, since it may involve encrypting these messages for security reasons. Additionally, sometimes when messages are sent, special characters and emojis may become unidentifiable symbols when they are reconstructed after compressing (in the case of larger texts that store more memory) and encrypting, which is a possible bug that may happen.
2. Unit tests are perfect for testing smaller (isolated) specifications of an application, and this also applies to requirements like a word cap of 80 characters. Unit tests are small and run fast, and donâ€™t take long to run simple tests like checking the word cap.
